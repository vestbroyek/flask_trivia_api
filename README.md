# Trivia API 
This API can be used to retrieve and post trivia questions in a variety o categories. It also powers a React web app. 

The API has endpoints for retrieving available categories, all questions for a specific category, for retrieving, posting, and deleting questions, and for initiating a trivia quiz (see API Reference below).

## Getting started 
To get started with the API, you'll need to set up both the backend and the frontend.

### The backend
#### The database
To set up your database, run a Postgres container (or set up a local server) with 

`docker run -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=student -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -e POSTGRES_DB=trivia postgres`

This will map your machine's port 5432 to the container's 5432, so you will be able to access the database, called `trivia`, at `localhost:5432`, with username `student` and password `password`. 

Then, in the database, run `backend/trivia_init.sql` to create the tables and set up permissions.

#### Flask
To get the API running, make a virtual environment, navigate to the `backend` folder, and install dependencies with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. Note that these dependencies have been tested with Python 3.10.9. If you are using a different version (especially <3.10), you may need to tweak the versions on Flask, flask-sqlalchemy, SQLAlchemy, and Jinja2.

Next, from the `backend` folder, ensure you run `export FLASK_APP=flaskr` and then run `flask run`. The app is defined in `__init__.py`. 

### The frontend
From the `frontend` folder, run `npm install`. (If you don't have npm installed, run `brew install node` or similar for your OS first). Then run `npm start`. You should now be able to access `localhost:3000` and see the app. 

### Tests
Tests are defined in `backend/test_flaskr.py`. They rely on having a test database set up. This is expected to be called `test_trivia`. To run tests, first create the database by running `create database test_trivia`, editing your connection to connect to this database (instead of to `trivia`, the "production" database), and re-run `trivia_init.sql`. 

Now you can run `test_flaskr.py`. 

## API reference
### Getting started
- Base URL: At present this app can only be run locally and is not hosted as a base URL. The backend app is hosted at the default, `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, which is set as a proxy in the frontend configuration. 
- Authentication: This version of the application does not require authentication or API keys.
